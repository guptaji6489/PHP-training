Hello World
Very happy to meet you all
I know what is 1 + 1 = <?php print 1 + 1 . "\n" ?>
<?php
echo "I can also span across multiple lines.\n";
echo 'single quotes can be used but with a difference.\n';
// echo 'I am a single line comment';
/*
echo 'I am under a multi line comment';
*/
# This is also a comment notation but rarely used
print 'Finally reached the end';
?>
// Say: Multiple line comments can not be nested
/* This may not work */
# Even this
